## Act 1 - The Return
The party returns to Saul's house and finds him complicit. First they need to find the [[Key to the City]]. One can be looted from the body of [[Cassie Caldwell]]. There's a good chance that players have missed this. There's a newly formed crater if they try to leave. This is carved out by [[The Dragon]] who we probably won't have time to actually fight.

## Act 2 - The Lab
The party finds the lab. Maybe there's a battle or two. Here they find out Saul's involvement. There's a terminal with some emails on it.

## Act 3 - The Confrontation
There's a final show down. Elizabeth Thorpe talks to the party through some bulletproof glass before injecting herself with [[Azurium Zephyrite]] and turning herself into a giant monster. You can use the stats for the Titan.

Elizabeth's motive isn't about profit or control. It's about preparation. The hybrids are strains of alien DNA. She wants to study the effects in a controlled environment before an invasion occurs on earth.
