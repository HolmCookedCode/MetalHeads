## Background
Church is filled with drones.  The clinic collapses and combines with the [[Azurium Zephyrite]] in the old children's graves.

There is yelling from underneath the altar. [[Judas Churchill]] is stashed down there. It was a chamber that has been there since the founding of the church. He hid there when he heard the commotion. There are screens in this chamber- kind of like in a Saw movie what the conductor of the game uses to monitor victims. Judas says they have always been off. There's not an interface to turn them on. Just kind of embedded into the walls.

One monitor shows the hybrids building a tower of some kind in the woods.
Another monitor shows a group of militia barricading Big Joey's tavern with some survivors.
Another monitor shows a group of police, including Grant and Frank setting up a blockade at the edge of town.
A monitor shows the inside of the EverTree chemical facility. There are a few bodies and more hybrids. You see what looks like black ops soldiers walking through and entering an elevator. This elevator takes them downward. (Guy knows the elevator downstairs requires top level clearance. He does not have clearance beyond that but can investigate based on rumors he has heard).
Another monitor shows Saul at a similar chamber. This chamber has a keyboard. He's typing something. The monitor shortly goes to static.

The shed has a Shotgun + two mags: +1/+1/-2/X, Short Range, Slow Reload. Two pistol mags. A bullet proof vest.
