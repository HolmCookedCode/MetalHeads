## Background
The town is flooded with members from the CDC. In reality, these are [[Synthetics]] sent by [[Elizabeth Thorpe]] to control the town. Elizabeth has been monitoring the town for some time and has profiles on all of the prominent residents. She can send in replacement synthetics for individuals she wants to mimic.

## Questions
1. Does anyone remember the name of employees we established for [[Zara Sadabris]]? I did not write any of them down. If nobody remembers then it doesn't matter.

## Ice Berg
### Depth 0
The story begins at the police station. [[Grant Phillips]] advises the team to head down to the police station. He'll monitor [[Ross Chapman]].
### Depth 1
#### The Police Station (Investigation)
The police station is ransacked. If the player's do not have weapons. They are able to loot pistols from here. Possibly a single shotgun. If the player's do have weapons from character creation, they are able to get pistol or shotgun mags here.
##### Clues
- The party can find orders for a raid on [[David Whittaker]]'s farm. There is a gathering there. Sort of a party. Illegal sale of firearms and narcotics.
- The entire place reeks of gasoline.
- There is evidence of a fire fight.
- There are reports of missing cats & dogs (referenced by [[Grant Phillips]] in the intro). There are a dozen reports of missing people. If questioned, Grant has been looking into the missing animals but is fully unaware of missing people.
- File detailing the vagrants at the [[Abandoned Factory]]. Note of "Potential for special investigation"?
- [[Crazy Eddy]] and [[Big Joey]] are also on the list.
#### The Trailer Park
This is where Crazy Eddy lives. Eddy has formed a small [[Militia]] and barricade of several trailers. His group is immediately distrustful of anyone approaching. He's already encountered synthetics and fully believes the party to be synthetics.
#### Joe's Tavern
Joe would be willing to hear the party out. He's part of [[The Wood Watchers]]. He might have theories about what's going on and be able to combat whatever the thing is. [[Katia Nesham]] is also here. They haven't encountered any synthetics and this scene is much calmer. They are about to have a meeting. It's small and sad as people share stories of the spooky things around town.
#### The CDC
Possibly use a stack for this. When it runs out, the [[Synthetics]] have found the players. They will appear in hazmat suits and state the entire town is under quarantine. If the players attempt to leave the town, they will also encounter a blockade. The basic models that the players will encounter in mass have an eerie cheer to them. Something is off about the way they interact with people.

If the party gets on the run, they might encounter [[Hannah Watson]] who is a more advanced model. She will advise the party to work with the government.
#### David's Farm
Here is the gathering of [[The Union]]. They are drinking and lamenting their missing comrades. Getting riled up with conspiracies. The missing loggers are in order.
1. Zander Church
2. Skylar Bean
3. Kyle Ritter
First it was rumored that Zander was lost. Maybe he drank too much and a bear got him. When Skylar went missing. People started suspecting foul play. Now Kyle is gone. The Union is discussing what to do.
### Depth 2
### The Chemical Facility
This is where the resident evil type of game can take place. You want to trap the players here and fill it with puzzles and monsters. I need to herd them to here somehow.
