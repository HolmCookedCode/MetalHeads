### Depth 0
#### The Doctor is In (Combat)
The party is split in two. [[Richard Dochter]] is at his office joined by [[Guy David Zeezed]]. [[George Chapman]] comes pounding on the door panicked. His brother [[Ross Chapman]] is in the car passed out. He's been bit by some dog. The bite looks pretty bad. When the party manages to get Ross inside, his wounds are healed. His skin is pale, but he has these extremely dark veins that seem to fade. Ross opens his eyes- they now appear to be filled with blood as he lashes out. The party must survive an [[Emergent]].
#### The Check In (Combat)
[[Zara Sadabris]] and [[Rodrigo Delmar]] are at [[The Furniture Shop]]. [[Grant Phillips]] comes by to see if [[Crazy Eddy]] has been around harassing her. There's a festival planned for tomorrow. Eddy likes to stir trouble and Grant wants to prevent that this year. There is a crash from the back of the shop. Here the party sees the [[Infected Dog]]. Wounded, bloody, and snarling. It's going to pounce.

These two scenes play back and forth likely resulting in combat. George and Grant try to guide the parties suggesting they reconvene at the police station. The cops should know what to do.
