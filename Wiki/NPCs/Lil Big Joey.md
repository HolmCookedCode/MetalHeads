Known as Lil' Big Joey. Owner of [[Joey's Tavern]]. Real name is Joe Hooper.

The tavern isn't doing well. He believes on helping those he can over running a successful business. He's probably given out too many meals. Joey is a giant of a man that just wants to be loved. This is what gives him the name lil big Joey.

Joey has especially given shelter to [[Katia Nesham]]. He's one of the people she trusts. They are both true believers. Joey is the loneliest and most down to earth of his compatriots. He tracked down [[Crazy Eddy]] and formed [[The Wood Watchers]] with Katia.
