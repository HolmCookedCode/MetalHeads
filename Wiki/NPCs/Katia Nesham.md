An artist is known throughout [[Cherryville]] and paints on the street corner. Katia is an elderly woman. She likes to take things slow. Her work is some of the best because she demands perfection. Mastery is all that matters. If you can't do it right, you go at it again until it's done right.

Katia hears the sounds in the woods. She has an obsession with capturing them. Every night she can be seen staring into the woods and painting. Never quite satisfied. Something isn't right she would say.

Katia is a collector. She's a bit of a spiritualist. She believes in the paranormal and energies connected to the world.

Katia is a bit of a loner. She doesn't feel a connection with the town, but rather the place. She likes stories and individuals, but she hates people and crowds.
