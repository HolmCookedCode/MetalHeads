Edward Patton is the town's conspiracy theorist. He was onto the real events of the town ever since [[The Blue Rock Fire]]. Formerly a journalist and writer. He's fallen off in the last few years and living off what he's saved up. He's been suspicious of [[Saul Sadabris]] for good reason. Aside from his correct theories. He has many wrong ones. He's a bit of a drunk and causes scenes at public events.

Unbeknownst to the public, he has been writing. He knows there is something wrong with the trees. He knows that the town dreams of the woods. He knows there is something out there.
