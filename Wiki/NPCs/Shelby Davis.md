Real name Vera Harlow. Vera shares with her partner Theo in that she sees the job done. 

While Theo is a hedonist, Vera has a lust for power. She's younger. She has ambitions. Even when she is Shelby Davis for her employers, she wears another mask even to them. Vera can't be trusted.

Vera is an anarchist. While Theo lives in the moment. Vera has a plan. She sees the way to fight corruption is to join it and wield power. She sees all those who don't agree with this as na√Øve children. She'll kill them if she has to. She'll feel nothing when she does it.

She has a soft spot for Theo. A useful idiot. She knows what he wants from her. She's let him have it a few times. If he dies? So be it. If someone tries to kill her favorite pet? She'll burn them to the ground.
