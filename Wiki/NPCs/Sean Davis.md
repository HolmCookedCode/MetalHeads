Part of the [[The Davises]]. His real name is Theo Gaetz.

Theo is good at one he does. He's been cleaning up messes left by [[NeuroSynth]] for years. His flaw? Theo is supposed to be discreet, but he's also a horndog. His success is mixed, but he always tries.

Theo is a hedonist. A drug addict. He kills and he fucks. Theo doesn't exactly have a plan in his life. This makes him the perfect stooge for the company.

Theo is a loyalist in a way. He won't turn against the company. Not because he is a true believer. Not because of the friends he's made along the way, but because Theo is a hedonist- he makes good money. He likes to spend money. He'll never do anything to disrupt that if he can walk away from it.
