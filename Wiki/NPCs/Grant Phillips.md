A member of the Cherryville [[Police]].

Grant sees himself as the force of the town. He has a mission in life and it's to help those in need. There's a certain insecurity about him. Grant doesn't want to be the hero of the town. He needs to be.

Grant has a yearning to travel. It's at odds with the story he's built for himself. He's kind of the former loser that built himself up but never adapted to new circumstances. He can never really take that leap to truly transform his life into that next stage.

The thing about Grant is earning the affection he never had growing up. He can never fake things. He can't take shortcuts. He can't cheat. Everything needs to be by the books even if against insurmountable odds.
