## Bad Guys - Template 4
OOOXOOOXO

**Attack:** 2 Critical
**Defense:** Critical
## Feats
**Fighters:** Heroes suffer -1 when rolling to hit the Enemy without firearms or ranged weapons.

**One Step Ahead:** The Enemies have no Weak Spot. If a Hero tries to find the Enemyâ€™s Weak Spot
and succeeds, they immediately realize there is none and lose 1 Grit due to the
disheartening discovery.
## Special Actions
**\[2]Chaos:** The Enemies scatter around, break everything in sight, and cause a racket, or
they set off an alarm, or start a small fire. From now on, the Heroes are dazed in the chaos and can no longer spend Adrenaline to gain +1 to their rolls.
# Story Notes
[[Sean Davis]] got himself arrested harassing [[Kimmy Green]]. [[Brooke Bauer]] threw him out. The commotion got him arrested. [[Shelby Davis]] had to pull him out. Sean is dumb but not incompetent. He was able to gather that the cops in the town had been replaced with synthetics. He placed his one phone call to his "wife". A shootout occurs. They hid the bodies. The plan was to torch the place. They managed to cover the place in gasoline. A [[Cyber Soldier]] showed up. They drove off with the bodies piled into a van.
