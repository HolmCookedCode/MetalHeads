**Attack:** Extreme
**Defense:** Critical
## Feats
**Martial Arts:** All Heroes who cannot rely on the Martial Arts Feat suffer -1 to their Action and
Reaction Rolls against the Enemy while in Melee or Close Range.

**One Step Ahead:** The Enemies have no Weak Spot. If a Hero tries to find the Enemyâ€™s Weak Spot
and succeeds, they immediately realize there is none and lose 1 Grit due to the
disheartening discovery.

**Walking Hazard**: Attacking the Enemy Requires a Dangerous Action Roll.
## Special Actions
**\[2]Chaos:** The Enemies scatter around, break everything in sight, and cause a racket, or
they set off an alarm, or start a small fire. From now on, the Heroes are dazed in the chaos and can no longer spend Adrenaline to gain +1 to their rolls.
