## Bad Guys - Template 4
OOOXOOOXO

**Attack:** 2 Critical
**Defense:** Critical
## Feats
**Automatic Weapons:** Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Nervous. If they are already Nervous, they lose 1 additional Grit.

**Bulletproof Vests:** Heroes suffer -1 when rolling to hit the Enemy with firearms or ranged weapons.

**Tactics:** When a Hero wants to use a Quick Action to get closer or farther from the Enemy, they must flip a coin. Heads: the Enemy anticipates the move, the range doesn’t change, and the Hero loses their action. Tails: the Hero repositions successfully.
## Special Actions
**\[1]Counter:** After a Hero has dealt a blow, the Enemy quickly counters with a sharp blow. The Hero loses the same amount of Grit that the Enemy has just lost.

**\[1]Flashbang!:** The Enemies toss a flash grenade that explodes in the middle of the battlefield
causing a loud bang and a flash of light. Heroes who fail a Critical Reaction Roll in Nerves + Awareness become Distracted and suffer -1 to their next roll.

**\[2]Surround:** The Enemies surround the Heroes, or lie in wait all around them to limit
their movements. From now on, during their Action Turns, Heroes must sacrifice 1 Grit in order to get access to their free Quick Action.

**\[2]Weak Spot:** The Enemies find and take advantage of a Hero’s weak spot. That Hero suffers -2 to their next Reaction Roll.
