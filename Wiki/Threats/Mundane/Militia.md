**Attack:** Critical
**Defense:** Critical

## Feats
**Automatic Weapons:** Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Nervous. If they are already Nervous, they lose 1 additional Grit.

**Hard to Kill:** When the Enemy reaches a Hot Box, they get 1 Adrenaline as usual, but lose no additional Grit because of the attack. For example, if an Enemy stands to lose 3 Grit because of a Heroâ€™s attack, the Director fills in Grit boxes up to the Hot Box, and not after it.
## Special Actions
**\[2]Grenade:** During a Reaction Turn, the Enemies do not attack. Instead, one of them
throws a grenade. All Heroes involved must make a Dangerous Extreme Reaction Roll in
Brawn + Stunt. If a Hero scores an Impossible Success, they can bounce the grenade back to
the thrower, their friends do not lose Grit, and the Enemy is defeated.
