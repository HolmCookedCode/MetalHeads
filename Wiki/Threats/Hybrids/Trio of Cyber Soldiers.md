*This is getting out of hand. Now there's three of them!*

Three [[Cyber Soldier]]s working in coordination.
## Predator Aliens - Template 4
OOXOOXOOX

**Attack:** Extreme
**Defense:** Critical

## Feats
**Arsenal:** When a cyber soldier attacks, they choose the effects of automatic weapons, flaming weapons, or explosive weapons.

**Reinforced Plates:** Heroes suffer -1 when rolling to hit the enemy with firearms or ranged weapons.

**Terrifying:** Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction turn become scared. Already Scared heroes become nervous.

**Cyberweapons:** Cannot be disarmed.

**Flaming Weapons:** All Heroes who are in Melee with the Enemy at the end of their Action Turn suffer -1 to their next Reaction Roll.

**Explosive Weapons:** During Reaction Turns, all rolls made by Heroes are considered Gambles.

**Automatic Weapons:** Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Nervous. If they are already Nervous, they lose 1 additional Grit. 

## Special Actions
**\[1]Targeting:** Until the Director uses another Special Action, one Hero will suffer -1 to all Action and Reaction Rolls against the Enemy.

**\[2]The Whole Arsenal:** Heroes who fail a Critical Reaction Roll (Dangerous) in Nerves + Detect will become hurt.

**\[2]Grenade:** During a Reaction Turn, the Enemies do not attack. Instead, one of them
throws a grenade. All Heroes involved must make a Dangerous Extreme Reaction Roll in
Brawn + Stunt. If a Hero scores an Impossible Success, they can bounce the grenade back to
the thrower, their friends do not lose Grit, and the Enemy is defeated.
