*Oh, there is something VERY wrong with that dog.*
## Predator Aliens - Template 2
OXOXOX

**Attack:** 2 Critical
**Defense:** Critical
## Feats
**Titan:** Heroes cannot deal more than 1 Grit per every attack to the Enemy.

**Whirring Blades:** Attacking the Enemy while in Melee or Close Range requires a Dangerous Action Roll.

**Terrifying:** Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become
Scared. If they are already Scared, they become Nervous.

**Relentless:** The Enemies ignore Covering Fire. Heroes who lay down Covering Fire use up
both their turn and mag, but gain no advantage.

**Evolved:** This creature gains three additional grit (already reflected in profile).
## Special Actions
**\[1]Tackle:** An Enemy charges toward a Hero, tackling them head-down. If the Hero fails
a Dangerous Critical Reaction Roll in Brawn + Force, they lose their footing and suffer -1 to their next roll.
