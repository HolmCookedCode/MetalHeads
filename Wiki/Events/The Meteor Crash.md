In 1991, a meteorite crash landed in [[Cherryville]]. A young engineer named [[Noah Quinn]] had found the meteorite. It was small enough to keep secret. It had a strange blue hue to it. This lead him to the creation of [[Blue Rock Manufacturing]]. He was able to extract material from the meteorite and attempted to replicate it in computer chips. The synthetic material he could replicate from the meteorite lead to a level of conductivity and durability to give him a market advantage.
